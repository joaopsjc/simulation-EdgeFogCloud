This simulation illustrates an Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture that
makes use of the approach presented by the article Functiona-
lities as a Service - An Approach to Conciliate Interoperability
 and Data Reduction in E-Health. In this Simulation, two appli-
cations make use of the Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture to share
 data and to store and analyze that data. The architecture medi-
 ates the communication between the two applications and apply
 a data reduction technique to lower the costs of transporting
  and storing the data.
